Problem Set 2 - Quantitative Macroeconomics: 

In this folder you can find:

	PS2_SergiQuintana.ipynb-->Jupyter Code for the answers
	QM-F20_HMK2 --> Questions to be answered
	Quantitative_Macroeconomics_PS2--Answers
	Figures --> Folder that contains all the figures.

Even if the Python code is fully comented, to find a explanation
of the results found should use the pdf with answers.
